## What's This?

My Semester 3 DSA lab work - **13 C++ programs** that taught me patience and pointers, plus **6 Python programs** that reminded me coding can actually be fun.

**Want the full story?** Check out the detailed READMEs:
- 📘 [**C++ Adventures**](CPP/README.md) - *Where segfaults taught me more than textbooks*
- 📗 [**Python Adventures**](Python/README.md) - *When coding finally felt like a conversation*

## 🗂️ Quick Look
```
DSA-Practicals/
├── CPP/           → Sorting, Stacks, Queues, Searching, Memory
└── Python/        → Trees, Graphs, Greedy, Strings
```

**19 implementations** across sorting algorithms, data structures, graph theory, and more.

---

## Running the Code

### C++
```bash
g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
./program_name
```

### Python
```bash
python3 program_name.py
```

*(That's it.)*

## 📊 What's Inside

| Topic | C++ | Python | Highlights |
|-------|-----|--------|------------|
| **Sorting** | 5 algorithms | 1 elegant version | Bubble to Merge, O(n²) to O(n log n) |
| **Trees** | - | BST with all ops | No pointers, just vibes |
| **Graphs** | - | Kruskal & Prim | MST algorithms that click |
| **Stacks** | 2 conversions | - | Infix ↔ Postfix/Prefix |
| **Searching** | 2 methods | - | Linear honesty, Binary speed |
| **Greedy** | - | Knapsack | One-line list comprehension magic |

## The Real Learning

**C++** taught me:
- How computers actually work
- Why memory management matters
- That segfaults build character

**Python** taught me:
- How humans should write code
- That readability is a feature
- Life is too short for manual memory management

Both taught me: *Different tools for different problems. Choose wisely.*

## 🌟 Why Read the Full READMEs?

Because they're not just documentation - they're:
-  The actual journey (struggles, breakthroughs, late-night realizations)
-  War stories from the trenches (segfaults, pointer pain, list comprehension enlightenment)
-  Honest comparisons (when to use what and why)

**Seriously, read them.** They make the code make sense.

## Navigation

**Start here based on your vibe:**

- 😤 *"I want to understand computers"* → [C++ README](CPP/README.md)
- 😌 *"I want to get things done"* → [Python README](Python/README.md)
- 🤓 *"I want both"* → Read both (recommended!)

## 📝 Final Note

This repo isn't perfect. Some code could be cleaner. Some approaches could be more efficient. But it's real, it's honest, and it represents actual learning.

**The best code is code that works. The second best is code you understand.**
